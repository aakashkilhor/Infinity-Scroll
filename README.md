# Continuous Scroll View - React Project

This project is a React implementation of a continuous scroll view or growable list, similar to the feeds in Instagram or Facebook. It fetches a list of images from an API and displays the image along with the author's name. Additionally, it adds a special message when the user stops scrolling on specific cells.
